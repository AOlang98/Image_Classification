# Image_Classification :  Facial Expression Classifier using Keras with ReLU Activation
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to build a robust facial expression classifier using the popular Keras library with the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. The goal of this project is to accurately predict whether a person's facial expression is "happy" or "sad" based on input images.

## Executive Summary
This project showcases the development of a facial expression classifier using Keras, a high-level neural networks API, and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. The primary objective was to create a model that can accurately distinguish between "happy" and "sad" facial expressions in input images.

### Key Highlights

- Deep Learning Foundation: Leveraging Keras, the project offers a practical demonstration of deep learning techniques in image classification, with potential applications in emotion recognition and human-computer interaction.

- ReLU Activation: The utilization of the ReLU activation function provides the model with non-linearity, enhancing its capacity to learn intricate patterns in facial expressions.

- Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing techniques, including image resizing, pixel value normalization, and dataset augmentation, were employed to enhance model generalization.
